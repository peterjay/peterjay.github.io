title: Resolving the 'Call Failed' error on the iPhone
---

It doesn't matter where you are, if you have a full signal or not, it will eventually happen. Probably when you least expect it, when your phone is out of reach and you would like to make that important phone call. But you can't, your phone is not letting you do so. And then you know... **"Call Failed"** _Again._

It happened to me numerous times on my iPhone 6 running iOS 8 and iOS 9 as well. I naively thought that replacing the phone with an iPhone 6s would solve this problem for me, but no, this problem remained.

To resolve this problem, some suggest toggling the Airplane mode on and off, but that never helped in my case. The only solution that I've found working (although not permanently) is tapping or toggling the _Show My Caller ID_ in the _Settings_ app under _Phone_. If you experience the same problem, this would be your best bet to rectify the situation.

I have tried to get to the bottom of this, but I couldn't figure out why is this happening. Maybe it has to do with Bluetooth being toggled on and off more regularly. It makes no sense, but now that I have a reason to keep Bluetooth turned on all the time, I haven't seen this error in a while. 

Apple, please fix this issue once and for all!
