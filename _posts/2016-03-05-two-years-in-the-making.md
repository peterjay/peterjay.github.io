title: Two years in the making
---

Before I finally committed to writing this very first post I had to get the source code of this blog back into shape again. You know, the usual stuff: running `git pull` on the local copy, updating the Jekyll installation, tweaking some bits here and there, etc. I have checked out the commit history as well. Not sure why I did that, but what I have seen there, surprised me:

>It's been almost two years since I originally set this blog up!?

And since then not a single post has been written. To be fair, it's been quite a busy period in my life:

- Me and my girlfriend of 2+ years got engaged
- Moved to a new apartment
- Got a promotion
- Seen valuable colleagues leaving
- Been to a couple of new destinations (Barcelona, *finally!*)

just to name a few.

Now, that I had taken the initiative, I will commit myself to writing an article every week or every other week. It is not a massive commitment but I hope I will be able to stick to it. Time will tell ðŸ™‚

## So, what will be this blog about?

All things Apple, gadgets, tech reviews, my frustrations and how-to's from the IT world, travel adventures, cars and about my attempt to live a bit more happier and most importantly *healthier* life. If you feel like it, please join me in this journey!

Let's get started, shall we?
