title: Post Instagram photos to Twitter
---

Back in the early days of Instagram it was straightforward to share Instagram images *as images*, but Twitter decided to take action against this (if I recall correctly, when Facebook acquired Instagram).

So, what should you do to have *actual* images in your tweets as opposed to boring and ugly links? Sign up for the [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) service!

IFTTT, which stands for "If This Then That" is a service that lets you effortlessly join Internet services together and run actions (the *IF* part) when certain events occur (the *THEN* part, for example: when you post to Instagram, post that image to Twitter as well, *or* save the image to a Dropbox folder).

To start, create an IFTTT account, then find the ["Share your Instagram pics as native Twitter photos"](https://ifttt.com/recipes/103249-share-your-instagram-pics-as-native-twitter-photos) recipe, and connect your Instagram and Twitter accounts with IFTTT.

From now on, when you post an image to Instagram, you will see your photos in the tweets. Granted, the tweet will not be posted the same moment you tapped the *Post* button, but it will arrive soon enough (there is a delay - polling period to be exact - of up to 15 minutes, so be patient). Oh and don't forget to untick (or not tick) the Twitter sharing button in Instagram, otherwise you will end up with two tweets for a single Instagram post.
